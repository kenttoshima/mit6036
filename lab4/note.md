# MIT 6.036 - Lab 4 (marie_kent_3886)
## 1
- 1a --
- 1b no - there is a cutoff of step size that diverges but not for init value
- 1c change in theta is small enough
- 1d --
- 1e local minimum
- 1f
- 1g no - there is no local optimum; as long as step size is small
- 1h deterministic - by tuning parameter it will converge to a local optiumum
- 1i there is a chance that it will find an answer over local optimum
- 1j it might diverge or too slow to converge (because of initial value, step size, number of steps)

## 2
- 2a $$\sum_{i=1}^n(l-i - p)^2$$

3b it is representative of the populatio - it's not good if you wanna suggest something
