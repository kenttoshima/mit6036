# 1
1a. horizontal line, since only theta0 would be in effect.
1b. complete match to all the data point data.
1c. overfits to the dataset
1d. magnitude of theta increases as there are more elements to fit
1e. 3
1f. it is indeed 3
1g. yes
1h. inverse could not be taken

# 2
2a. overfits to the datapoints
2b. 0
2c. lambda should be 0.10. of course it is not the same as the value on the training set since it is meant to prevent the learned line from overfitting.

# 3
3a. 0.1 was already good for order 1;  0.4 is good for order 2
3b. .03 and .015 was too small a step to converge to analytical answer with only 1000 steps
 # 4
 4a. no. there are some groups of data points that shows reduction of heart desease cases.
 4b. the higher the age group you belong to, the higher the risk you have
 4c. dividing the datasets into groups and run the model separately would help.
 4d. Plot! and divide datapoints based on age
